# Version-standard comparison: SemVer, ecosystem policies, Conventional Commits, CalVer

This file is the **source of authority** for the `version-decide` skill's decision logic. Every rule comes from the official text of the standards below (verified 2026-10), no speculation. The decision flow is in `../SKILL.md`.

---

## 1. SemVer 2.0.0 (Semantic Versioning)

Source: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

### Core rules (key points)

| Clause | Rule |
|---|---|
| §2 | Version must be `X.Y.Z`, each segment a non-negative integer, **no leading zeros** |
| §3 | A published version's contents **must not be modified**; any change must ship as a new version |
| §4 | **0.y.z is initial development. Anything may change at any time; the public API must not be considered stable** |
| §5 | 1.0.0 defines the public API; how to increment afterwards depends on how that API changes |
| §6 | Increment PATCH only for backward-compatible bug fixes |
| §7 | Increment MINOR for new backward-compatible functionality; **any public API feature marked deprecated must also increment MINOR**; reset patch |
| §8 | Increment MAJOR for any backward-incompatible change; reset minor and patch |
| §9 | Pre-release: `-` + dot-separated identifiers, ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens only, no leading zeros in numeric identifiers; **pre-release has lower precedence than the associated normal version** |
| §10 | Build metadata: content after `+` **does not affect precedence**; traceability only |
| §11 | Precedence comparison rules (below) |

Note that the applicability conditions of §6/§7/§8 all carry the `(x > 0)` qualifier — **this is exactly where the spec leaves 0.x blank**, and the root of the divergent ecosystem interpretations.

### §11 official precedence example (must hold item by item)

```
1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta
          < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0
```

Comparison rules: ① major/minor/patch compared numerically; ② same core → pre-release lower than normal; ③ pre-release compared left-to-right field by field, **numeric fields by value, alphanumeric fields by ASCII, and numeric fields have lower precedence than alphanumeric** (so `1.0.0-1 < 1.0.0-alpha`); ④ same prefix → more fields wins.

### SemVer FAQ advice on 0.x

> The simplest thing to do is start your initial development releases at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.

## 2. Conventional Commits 1.0.0

Source: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

### Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Mapping to SemVer

| Commit | Level |
|---|---|
| `fix:` | PATCH |
| `feat:` | MINOR |
| footer contains `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or `!` after type/scope | MAJOR |
| other types (`build` `chore` `ci` `docs` `style` `refactor` `perf` `test`) | **no implicit effect** |

Key text: a breaking change **may be part of any type** (§3); types other than `feat`/`fix` have "no implicit effect on SemVer" (§14).

### Three easily-misused FAQ answers

1. **What about 0.x?** The official text suggests: "**pretend the product is already released**" — because someone may already be using your software. This **directly conflicts** with SemVer §4 ("may change at any time") and the actual npm/cargo behavior (see §4).
2. **What about revert?** The spec **explicitly refuses to define** it: "Conventional Commits does not make an explicit effort to define revert behavior." It only suggests a `revert` type plus a `Refs:` footer.
3. **Wrong type used?** `git rebase -i` before merge; after release each tool handles it itself.

## 3. Official versioning policies per language / ecosystem

### Python — PEP 440 (**not SemVer**)

Source: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/ (PEP itself marked historical; the authoritative spec is now maintained by PyPA's Version specifiers)

Canonical form:

```
[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN][+local]
```

Five segments:

| Segment | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Epoch** `N!` | Switch the whole numbering scheme (e.g. from date `2014.04` to semantic `1!1.0`). Almost no project needs it |
| **Release** `N(.N)*` | The normal version; `1` / `1.4` / `1.4.2` all valid; short segments zero-padded on compare, so `X.Y` == `X.Y.0` |
| **Pre-release** `aN` / `bN` / `rcN` | **no hyphen**: `1.0.0a1`, `1.0.0rc1` |
| **Post-release** `.postN` | A revision after the normal release (e.g. packaging-script fix) |
| **Dev-release** `.devN` | A dev snapshot before pre-release |
| **Local** `+label` | A private marker for a downstream integration branch; **does not change the version type** |

Biggest difference from SemVer: **pre-releases have no hyphen**. `1.0.0-rc.1` is normalized to `1.0.0rc1`; what ends up in PyPI metadata, filenames, and lockfiles is the latter. Write version numbers in PEP 440 form by hand.

PyPA's versioning discussion page notes a real-world exception: **security fixes often have to include breaking changes yet still ship as patch**. This skill therefore maps `security` to patch by default, but requires extra confirmation for that scenario in `SKILL.md`.

### Rust — Cargo

Source: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html

**Compatibility rule: same leftmost non-zero segment = compatible** (unlike SemVer's "all pre-1.0.0 packages are mutually incompatible"):

| Dependency declaration | Actual range |
|---|---|
| `1.2.3` | `>=1.2.3, <2.0.0` |
| `0.2.3` | `>=0.2.3, <0.3.0` |
| `0.0.3` | `>=0.0.3, <0.0.4` |

Pre-releases are **not matched by default**; must be explicit; and `1.0.0-alpha` does not auto-upgrade to `1.0.1-alpha`.

### Go — Semantic Import Versioning

Source: https://go.dev/doc/modules/version-numbers

- **From v2 the module path must carry the major suffix**: `example.com/mod` → `example.com/mod/v2`. This implements the import-compatibility rule: same import path must be backward-compatible.
- v0 / v1 **must not** carry a suffix (`gopkg.in/` is the exception, using `.v2` form).
- Benefit: **different majors can coexist in one build**, resolving diamond-dependency conflicts.
- Historical projects that shipped v2 without a suffix are tagged `v2.0.0+incompatible`.
- v0 vs v1: in most cases v1 is still compatible with the last v0; **v1 is a "promise of compatibility", not "breaking relative to v0"**.

### Node.js — the runtime's own versioning policy

Source: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/evolving-the-nodejs-release-schedule

From October 2026 Node ships **one major per year** (April Current, October → LTS), and adds an **Alpha channel** (October to next March, 6 months) where **semver-major changes are allowed** during Alpha, using the standard SemVer pre-release form (e.g. `27.0.0-alpha.1`). Previously it was two majors per year, odd/even split into Current/LTS.

### CalVer (Calendar Versioning)

Source: https://calver.org/

`YY.MM.PATCH` (Ubuntu 24.10, pip 26.0.1, Black 26.3.1), `YYYY.MM.DD` (yt-dlp 2026.08.19), `YY.MINOR` (Apple, from 2025,全线 switched to year numbering: iOS 26 / macOS 26 / Xcode 26).

Neo4j is a recent migration case: **from January 2025 it switched from SemVer to CalVer** (`YYYY.MM.PATCH`), and in 2025.06 decoupled the Cypher language version from the server to evolve independently.

Applicability signal: release cadence strongly tied to the calendar, support windows that must be obvious at a glance, version number expressing "freshness" rather than compatibility.

## 4. Conflicts between standards (what the decision logic must handle)

| Conflict | SemVer 2.0.0 | Actual ecosystem behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Can 0.x break freely?** | §4: change anytime, API unstable | npm `^0.2.3` = `[0.2.3, 0.3.0)`, Cargo same; **minor bump IS the breaking boundary**. Composer (PHP) treats `^0.2.3` as `[0.2.3, 1.0.0)`, looser |
| **Commit convention in 0.x** | §4: no guarantee | Conventional Commits officially suggests "pretend already released" |
| **Is there an increment rule for 0.x?** | No explicit rule | Academic study (arXiv 2101.00836) found Cargo/npm/Packagist don't strictly follow; 0.y.z release frequency is not higher than ≥1.0.0; many projects never cross 1.0.0 |
| **Which level is deprecation?** | §7: must be MINOR | No dispute |
| **Security fix with breaking change** | Unspecified | In practice often shipped as patch |

**This skill's trade-off**: during 0.x adopt **npm/Cargo semantics** (minor = breaking boundary), because it is the package managers' actual behavior and truthfully protects dependents; and state this explicitly in the output.
